Project Spark: Network Security Analysis

link: https://spark.verastel.ai

Overview
Project Spark is a Python-based web application designed to enhance network security by analyzing the configuration files of routers and switches. The application offers two methods for analysis: uploading configuration files directly or connecting to devices via SSH to retrieve configurations. The project leverages a microservice architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability, integrating a suite of modern DevOps practices and tools.

Objectives
•	Automate the analysis of router and switch configuration files.
•	Identify potential security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
•	Provide detailed reports and recommendations for network security enhancements.
•	Ensure continuous integration and delivery of updates and features.

Key Features
•	Config File Analysis: Automated scripts to parse and analyze configuration files for security vulnerabilities.
•	SSH Connectivity: Securely connect to network devices via SSH to retrieve and analyze configurations.
•	Reporting: Generation of detailed reports with identified issues and recommended actions.
•	CI/CD Integration: Use of Jenkins pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
•	Containerization: Docker for containerizing the application to ensure consistent environments across different stages of development.
•	Orchestration: Kubernetes for managing containerized applications at scale.
•	Infrastructure as Code: AWS CloudFormation for defining and provisioning infrastructure.
•	Managed Kubernetes Service: Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for deploying, managing, and scaling Kubernetes applications.

Tools and Technologies
•	Python: The primary programming language for the web application.
•	Flask/Django: Web framework used to build the application.
•	GitHub: Version control and repository hosting.
•	Jenkins: Automating the CI/CD pipelines.
•	Docker: Containerization of the application.
•	Kubernetes: Orchestrating and managing containers.
•	AWS CloudFormation: Infrastructure as code for AWS resources.
•	Amazon EKS: Managed Kubernetes service for deploying applications.

Architecture
1.	Microservice Design:
o	Frontend Service: Handles the web interface for user interactions.
o	Backend Service: Processes configuration files and SSH connections for analysis.
o	Analysis Service: Analyzes the retrieved configurations and generates reports.
2.	Code Repository:
o	Source code and scripts stored in a GitHub repository.
o	Configuration files for routers and switches are stored securely.
3.	CI/CD Pipeline:
o	Jenkins Pipeline: Automated pipeline to build, test, and deploy the application.
o	Stages:
	Build: Dockerize the application.
	Test: Run automated tests for the configuration analysis scripts.
	Deploy: Deploy the Docker containers to the Kubernetes cluster.
4.	Containerization and Orchestration:
o	Docker: Create a Docker image of the application.
o	Kubernetes: Deploy and manage the Docker containers using Kubernetes.
o	Amazon EKS: Utilize Amazon EKS for a scalable and managed Kubernetes environment.
5.	Infrastructure Provisioning:
o	AWS CloudFormation: Define the infrastructure required for the application, including VPCs, subnets, security groups, and EKS clusters.

Project KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
•	Code Quality: Measured by automated tests and static code analysis tools integrated into the CI pipeline.
•	Deployment Frequency: Regular and automated deployment through Jenkins and Kubernetes.
•	Scalability: Ability to handle an increasing number of configuration files and larger network infrastructures.
•	Security Compliance: Number of security vulnerabilities identified and mitigated in network configurations.
